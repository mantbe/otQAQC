*  Needed work:
- Check that DSM > DEM.  Randomized points along surface and sample.
- Add routine to create set of randomized points in the boundary and
  sample the rasters.  Verify that DSM > DTM.
- for PDAL boundaries - need to put in checks for geometry errors.
- module to merged shapefiles - may already have one in my utils..
- check for multiple image formats.. (use set command)
- problems with Dissolve.  Need to check for errors.  sometimes it
  will jsut write out a dbf, and give no error
- all modules should probably take full path.  Then I can have a
  separate module that will split paths and return basename,
  dirname, filename without suffix, suffix only, etc.
- May need to put in a check that header variables haven't been
  changed from the originals?  Or could just do a comparison using this
  code to make sure the versions are the same?
- how to deal with the Boundary Creation better - when are there too
  many points? (NZ18_Marlbo).
- how to handle directories with *._ files.  ex: ._2017_DEF_50cm.flt
  This has already happened a couple of times.  spent too much time
  getting a regular expression that will filter it out.
- Deal with logs better.  maybe write out logs, and exit if there is an
  error for prod version.  In beta version, I could have it enter a ipdb
  session?
- Add routine to create KMZ from KML.  
- Put file count in the initial log somewhere.   
- Log should be a keyword input to modules, this way you could call a
  module from the command line without worrying about logging.  Move
  most log comments out of individual modules, and back into RunQAQC
  module.  On certain cases, you could use log in specific module by
  passing as keyword.  
- Write "Transform2Tiff_errors.txt" error file to logs or somewhere
  other than the directory with the rasters?
- PRIORITY - I GET BURNED ON THIS EVERYTIME!
  OUTDIR VS RASOUTDIR.  There is going to be confusion here.  How to
  get around this?  Use YML and group each module with its own
  parameters.  Don't know how I will get around parameters that are used
  in multiple functions?
- Why do I have to add a suffix when I am adding CRS to header and
  outputting to a different directory?  Logic is messed up here.  Refer
  to module AddCRS2Header.  Also in this module - how to handle if I
- want to add a CRS and convert to LAZ all in one step.  How to handle
  the output naming convention.  Right now it keeps it as .las, so need
  to think about this one.
- Add ability to scrape GPS time from LAZ files?  Min/Max GPS time
  could automate dates of survey.  May need GPS DOW.
- Add ability to create boundary from just rasters.
- Add check that all rasters are in the same CRS.  I have one module 
  already that can be adapted for this purpose.

*  Updates
-  06/09/2020.  Added the module, CreateLAZTile, which will take in a
  list of files, and create a tile boundary of the bounding box of
  the laz files.  This is useful for users who want to download
  specific sets of files from bulk.
-  11/05/2019.  Added the ability to check for empty lidar files.  For
  CA18_Feehan, there were some files with just a header.  The header
  also had bad MIN/MAX values.  When I converted it from las to LAZ,
  this made the header values blow up, and this caused an issue with
  Minh's input.  So, need to check for empty files.

*  BugFixes
-  

*  config File issues
-  GUI will provide flexibility, but you can't run a big job that 
   checks everything.  It will be a stepwise process.  it will also
   Take a lot of coding to get this set up.
-  YAML or JSONNET will accept comments.  YAML does now allow
   conditionals.
-  By having a single config file, you can only have a single log file
   Right now by having it in python, I am actually running the program
   multiple times, so I can have different log files for each step.
-  basically what I want is to be able to have comments in the config,
   but also to know which elements are required for each setting.
-  JSONNET so far seems to be a pain to read in.
-  Technically, I am not even using JSON right now, and I am using python
   So, I could put comments in the python ingest script.  The user still 
   won't know what parameters are required or which ones are available.  
   I could just put the kitchen sink in, with most of them commented out?
*  Docker version
-  I was able to get a docker container with pdal, gdal, and all python
  libraries.  I was also able to get wine working with lastools in a
  docker.  The problem is when wine is installed in a container, it
  somehow prevents pdal from working.  I suspect it is a user
  permissions issue, although I was able to login in as root using the
  entrypoint command in the docker file, but it still couldn't find
  pdal.  So, one option, is to keep a branch that will be for using
  docker, but it will be using only pdal?
