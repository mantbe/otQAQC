* Tasks
- [ ] PDAL logs created
- [ ] LAZ files exist?
- [ ] Are there any empty files?
- [ ] QA/QC on CRS and version of LAZ files - is it uniform?
- [ ] plot georeferenced LAZ to verify that the CRS in metadata is
      actually what the data is in (i.e. don't trust metadata?)
- [ ] Boundary created
- [ ] Area of boundary verified?
- [ ] Header values match input (i.e. nothing was accidentally altered)
- [ ] File counts match (for both rasters and pc)
- [ ] Rasters in tiff format?
- [ ] Rasters contain CRS info?
- [ ] Rasters all in same CRS?
- [ ] Rasters in same data type 
- [ ] if Orthos present, tile and compress to reduce size
- [ ] Is DSM > DEM?
- [ ] Can VRT be built?
- [ ] Does Raster boundary match lidar boundary?  Are there gaps
- [ ] Put Metadata into PDF format if necessary.
- [ ] Create registration page on xx/xx/xxxx
- [ ] Add logo to registration
- [ ] Create tile index for shapefiles and upload to cloud
- [ ] Uploaded LAZ, and rasters with rsync to beta on xx/xx/xxxx
- [ ] When data is made public, notify Minh to turn on "Bulk Download"
      option.
- [ ] When data is public, make sure you can see boundary in global view
      (especially for LINZ data).  If not, notify minh to update the
      boundaries .
- [ ] When data is made public add project to PI's registration page so
      they can see stats on their dataset (if applicable)
- [ ] When data is made public, add to Catalog Service for the Web (CSW)
